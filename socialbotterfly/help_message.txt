Here is the help for social_BOTterfly:

* I want periodic suggestions about other redditors so can make contact each other!

Send the bot a message with the subject being 'subscribe' withotu the quotes. Enter the following message (between the quotes) and add the required information:

'
position:
maximum distance:
things I like:
things I hate:
'

To get your position, please go to https://www.google.ca/maps/ and right-click -> More information for this location -> Copy and paste the coordinates. You can use other means to get your latitude and longitude if you want.

The maximum distance (in kilometers or miles, add the units!) is the maximum distance allowed between you and the other person.

The things you like are a comma-separated list of things you like. You will get preferentially matched with someone who likes the same things are you.

The things you hate are a comma-separated list of things you hate. You will not get matched with someone who likes one of these things.

* I don't want suggestions anymore!

Send the bot a message with the subject being 'unsubscribe' without the quotes. Make the message body non-empty.

* I want to leave a comment about possible enhancements for the bot!

* I want the help message!

Send the bot literally anything that's not one of the commands.
