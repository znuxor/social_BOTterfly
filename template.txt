Hello everyone and welcome to installment #{} of the weekly /r/socialskills challenge!

This week, the two challenges are:

1: {} (Thank you /u/{}!)

2: {} (Thank you /u/{}!)

# What is this?

Every week, two challenges appear, the second being more difficult than the first. By completing said challenges, you are awarded ⭐ points ⭐ that will be shown in your flair.

## Ok, so I completed one of last week's challenges, now how do I get my points?

To earn points, you will have to comment briefly (5 or more words on a comment) on the challenge(s) you have completed. You have until the next week to report.

To manage points, we will use a bot, it will read comments for lines starting with 1: or 2: and interpret them as insights on challenges to award points.

## I failed a challenge...

It's ok, one of the objectives is to give insights to other users. Feel free to comment on the challenge and you will get points too.

## I have a great challenge idea!

That's good, we need ideas for the weekly challenges. If you have an idea, please post it as a response to the stickied comment in this thread.
